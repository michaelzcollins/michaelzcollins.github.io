            <h2>How I Passed the Security+ and CySA+ Exams on My First Try</h2>
            <p>I had a fun time studying and preparing for the Security+ and CySA+ exams, and I wanted to share my experience with you to help others succeed on their first attempt.</p>

            <h3>1. Schedule the Exam</h3>
            <p>If you already have a foundation in cybersecurity knowledge, schedule your exam for about 3 weeks out. This will force you to stay on track and study consistently. In my opinion, the exams are not as hard as some people make them sound, especially if you dedicate time and effort to studying.</p>

            <h3>2. Watch or Listen to the Content in Full</h3>
            <p>There are many free resources available for content on these exams. I found that the exams stuck very closely to the material in these resources. Find a full course on YouTube and watch or listen to all of it. Do not skip any part of the content. I listened to these courses every night while doing my chores, at 1.5x speed. I'll link videos at the bottom for reference.</p>

            <h3>3. Take Notes of Everything You Don't Fully Understand</h3>
            <p>As you're listening or watching the course content, make a list of everything you do not fully understand. This could be any acronym or term. At the end of the course (or after each section), use a tool like ChatGPT to help create a study list with the terms you noted. This was incredibly helpful for me. Make sure you understand what each acronym stands for. Often, in exam questions, the answers are in the form of acronyms. Knowing the meanings behind them can give you an edge when answering questions. I would also ask ChatGPT to clarify the differences between terms that seem similar. As we all know, CompTIA loves to include multiple correct answers, so knowing the finer details of tools and terms can help you narrow down the options significantly.</p>

            <h3>4. Take Practice Tests</h3>
            <p>Practice tests are essential! I can't tell you how many times I’ve kicked myself for reading a question wrong. The questions on these exams are designed to be tricky and misleading. Many times, there are multiple correct answers, but you need to select the best one. For example, they might ask you, "What is the best way for a security analyst to respond to a ransomware attack?" You might see answers like:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A. Install a firewall</li>
                <li>B. Use a VPN</li>
                <li>C. Pay the ransom</li>
                <li>D. Use a SIEM and isolate infected networks</li>
            </ul>
            <p> Do keep in mind I just made this question up. Although several of these options could work, the best answer is most likely D, using a SIEM and isolating infected networks, since you should already have firewalls and VPNs in place. Practice tests help you become familiar with how questions are structured and give you a feel for the format. My first practice test score was around 60%. After gaining confidence with the material, I was able to raise that score to about 80%. Pace yourself when taking these tests, especially for the Security+ exam, which is very fast-paced. You'll have to answer up to 90 questions in 90 minutes. Practice answering questions quickly, and if you're unsure about a question, flag it and come back to it later.</p>

            <h3>5. Pass the Test!</h3>
            <p>Make sure to eat a healthy breakfast before your exam and use the restroom if you're taking the test at a test center. They will not allow you to get up once the exam starts.</p>

            <h3>Security+ vs CySA+</h3>
            <p>In my opinion, Security+ and CySA+ are very comparable. However, I found Security+ to be more fast-paced and that alone made it more challenging. You only have 90 minutes to answer up to 90 questions, so you'll have about 1 minute per question. Pace yourself carefully, and flag any questions you're unsure about. When you reach the end, review all of your flagged questions, as they may help you answer questions you skipped earlier. If you don’t know the answer to a question, skip it for now and come back to it later.</p>
            <p>CySA+, on the other hand, has more in-depth questions. You’ll need to understand how to read logs and learn about various tools. But, overall, the theory is very similar to Security+. What's nice about CySA+ is that you have more time – I believe you get about 2.5 hours for the exam, which makes it a bit easier to pace yourself.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Overall, I had a great time studying for both exams and was thrilled to pass them on my first try. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out. I'm always happy to chat about cybersecurity and share what I’ve learned!</p>
